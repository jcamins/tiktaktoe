This is a formal semantics of the board game Tic Tac Toe. The definition was
developed using the [K Semantic Framework](http://k-framework.org).

The goal of this project is to compare game definitions written in K to game
definitions written in [Game Definition Language](http://games.stanford.edu/gdl.html).
A specification of Tic Tac Toe in GDL can be found [on Stanford's Gamemaster
website](http://gamemaster.stanford.edu/gamemaster/games/tictactoe/tictactoe.kif).
